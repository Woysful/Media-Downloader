## This is a yt-dlp based program for downloading media.
The program was created to work through FlowLauncher.

## How to install
1. Place Downloader.exe and config.json in a convenient directory.
2. In FlowLauncher settings in the Plugins tab find Plugin Runner. It allows you to run programs not related to FlowLauncher.
3. Add the new item to the list.
4. In the Path section, specify the path to the executable file.
5. In the Arguments section, specify one of the 4 available arguments: ( video / video_best / audio / audio_best )
6. In the Shortcut section, specify a name to match the argument.
7. Add 3 more items and do the same but with different arguments.
8. Customize Config.json. It contains data on the preferred video and audio format, video download parapeters and the path to save the files.

## How to use
First, copy the link to the media that yt-dlp supports. In the open FlowLauncher window, specify the keyword for Plugin Runner and a drop-down list will appear with options for downloading media. The program will use the link from the clipboard and download the media to the path specified in config.

## Why is this a separate program and not a plugin for FlowLauncher?
I'm stupid and haven't figured out how to do that ᗜ˰ᗜ

## Why did you need to create this program when AnyDownloader already exists?
Because I like this approach, as well as the ability to control media download parameters.
